#  Iterative, Recursive and Direct Functions and their Complexity Analysis

On this excersice you will write a program that will implement 3 ways of doing a sumation.

- Iterative sumation
- Recursive sumation
- Direct sumation

## Requirements

All functionalities must be correctly aligned and documented (`in code`). As part of the documentation, the complexity of each of them must be included.

Function's name and definition
- `int interativeSum(int n)`
- `int recursiveSum(int n)`
- `int directSum(int n)`

Work in the [`sum.cpp`](./sum.cpp) file

You must add each function's execution time measurement, make sure to report the result and the execution time in the following format:

```
# Iterative Sum with n = 3
  - Result: 6
  - Execution time: 0.0001 seconds
# Recursive Sum with n = 3
  - Result: 6
  - Execution time: 0.0701 secons
# Direct Sum with n = 3
  - Result: 6
  - Execution time: 0.041 secons

```

## How you program should compiled and tested

Compilation

```
make
```

Tests
```
make test
```
